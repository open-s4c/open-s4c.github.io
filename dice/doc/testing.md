# Dice Testing Guide

Dice bundles several test layers to cover interceptors, pubsub behaviour, and
module integration. Use this guide to run the relevant subsets and understand
how to extend them.

## Test Layout

- `test/` (default target): unit-style checks for core components such as
  pubsub, mempool, and TLS helpers.
- `test/interpose/`: autogenerated harness that verifies each interceptor calls
  the real function and publishes the expected events. Function signatures live
  in `interposed.h.in`, and the generator produces one `.c` per module.
- `test/traces/`: integration scenarios that run small programs under Dice and
  assert specific events or ordering constraints using the `trace_checker`
  subscriber.
- `test/order/`: exercises module constructor/destructor ordering and link-time
  combinations to guard against regressions in preload behaviour.
- `test/cxx/`: some C++ specific tests, e.g., involving the lifetime of
  `__thread` global variables.
- Sanitizer-specific builds (ThreadSanitizer, AddressSanitizer) reuse the same
  source files but run with `-DDICE_SANITIZER=<tool>` to catch data races or
  memory bugs introduced by interceptors.

## Running Tests

```sh
cmake -B build
cmake --build build
ctest --test-dir build
```

### Focus on a Subset

- Interpose suite: `ctest --test-dir build -R interpose`
- Trace scenarios: `ctest --test-dir build -R trace_`
- Order/linking checks: `ctest --test-dir build -R order`

### Testing with sanitizers

```sh
cmake -B build-tsan -DDICE_SANITIZER=<thread|address|undefined>
cmake --build build-tsan
ctest --test-dir build-tsan
```

NOTE: That sanitizer tests do not work in all configurations.

## Extending Tests

- **Interpose tests**: add the new function signature to
  `test/interpose/interposed.h.in` (define `MM_RETURN_<name>`,
  `MM_PARAMS_<name>`, `MM_ARGS_<name>`). The generator will create a matching
  test that publishes events and compares payloads.
- **Trace tests**: add a new program under `test/traces/` and register it in
  `test/traces/CMakeLists.txt`. Use `scripts/dice` in the test command to load
  the required modules.
- **Order tests**: expand the scenarios in `test/order/` to cover additional
  link combinations or slots when you introduce new modules.

Refer back to `doc/contributing.md` for the checklist that reviewers expect when
new behaviours are added.
